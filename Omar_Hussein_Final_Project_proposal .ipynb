    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The gaming industry have been perennially pushing the boundaries of what is attainable. The video game market could very well be a $300 billion [1] industry by 2025 with contributions like cloud gaming, for instance Google’s stadia [2] as well as mobile games[3]. In fact, both retro and modern video games command the sort of cultural influence that was once reserved for other areas in the entertainment industry such as movies and TV-shows but it's a new age, now video-games are more prevalent than ever and they are on the rise [4].To put it into perspective, Rockstar games' \"GTA V\" is the most profitable entertainment product in history over-shadowing any other medium by a staggering 6 billion dollar revenue[5].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Scope\n",
    "Death stranding [6] is an upcoming  action game designed, written, produced and directed by the legendary hideo kojima and is set to be released in November 8th 2019, there has been a lot of ruckus regarding that game in the media, however in a lot of scenarios the media pother doesn't imply success for instance will smith's movie Gemini-man is facing 75$ million dollar loss which was a huge disappointing and was an unexpected upset[7]. So in this project we make belief that we are on the analytics team at Sony Computer Entertainment and we endeavor to think strategically about how we would market to the global audience or in this context gamers on the state level through text Sentiment-analysis based on Social Media Twitter."

    "# 2.Research Questions\n",
    "A lot of money has been spent on this game when you consider the names of the actors involved like Mads Mikkelsen, Troy baker and Norman Reedus[8] alone the expenses immediately sky-rocket, let alone the money paid in development and all the other areas in production, so it is imperative for the game to be a success.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So the questions that we should take into account are\n",
    "- How do people feel about our product and what do they say ?\n",
    "- Where should Sony market in the world ?\n",
    "- What is the percentage of positive and negative comments over the different regions ?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is this project relevant to the real world and is this endeavor even applicable?\n",
    "The answer is absolutely!. Not only is this project reproducible but it will remain relevant for as long as the entertainment industry is around it is very transferable and here are some examples[9]."

    "## Part I\n",
    "The first data source of this project  is a CSV from Kaggle [11]. This dataset contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies and it was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com based on BeautifulSoup using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vgsales fields include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rank - Ranking of overall sales\n",
    "- Name - The games name\n",
    "- Platform - Platform of the games release (i.e. PC,PS4, etc.)\n",
    "- Year - Year of the game's release\n",
    "- Genre - Genre of the game\n",
    "- Publisher - Publisher of the game\n",
    "- NA_Sales - Sales in North America (in millions)\n",
    "- EU_Sales - Sales in Europe (in millions)\n",
    "- JP_Sales - Sales in Japan (in millions)\n",
    "- Other_Sales - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions)\n",
    "- Global_Sales - Total worldwide sales.\n",

    "## Part II\n",
    "The second data source, and the main one, will come from Twitter, more specifically the tweets related to the Sony video game death stranding that we will get throw API requests and the data collected will be stored in a SQL database (the approach is explained in the next section). Considering the type of data here is text, the words used for classification are going to be obtained mainly from the wordNet database."

    "We split the project into two parts, and the bulk of the work is in the second part.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part I\n",
    "In this project we aim to understand the market more, so we start out by first using the vgsales data from Kaggle to understand how does Sony published games usually do from the sales perspective and will look at it from a global point of view, more specifically, among the 16,598 records contained in the dataset we will store the ones related to Sony Computer Entertainment exclusively in a SQL database. We plan to analyze the information regarding its sales and provide some summary statistics and graphics using Tableau, to understand the market a bit more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part II\n",
    "Then we will extract tweets about the game \"death stranding\" and perform requests to the social network Twitter using its API to collect tweets regarding death stranding. We plan to store the tweets and some other attributes such as its location in a SQL database. To be able to perform this we will create a Twitter developer account and use a Python library called Tweepy alongside with some other secondary libraries, then obtain the corresponding Keys and tokens to interact with the API to get the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API has some limitations in the amount of requests every 15 minutes, so we will perform this operation incrementally as time passes by, as we plan to understand how people react to death stranding in the hopes of answering our research questions and the way we intend to do this is through classifying the tweets into positive and negative in relation to their geographical location. For the tweets that don't have a geographical location they will be considered separately to have a comprehensive idea of the video game market's sentiment towards our product.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since the release date is on November 8, 2019 it is imperative to get more tweets around that time because we would like to know what type of improvements does Sony need to make inorder to make more money.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Description\n",
    "1. Pre-process each text (i.e. remove HTML tags, noisy characters). \n",
    "2. Initialize the total text sentiment score: s ← 0.\n",
    "3. Tokenize text. For each token, check if it is present in a sentiment dictionary.\n",
    " - (a) If token is present in dictionary,\n",
    " - i. If token is positive, then s ← s + w.\n",
    " - ii. If token is negative, then s ← s − w.\n",
    "4. Look at total text sentiment score s,\n",
    " - (a) If s > threshold, then classify the text as positive.\n",
    " - (b) If s < threshold, then classify the text as negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "In dictionary-based techniques the idea is to first collect a small set of opinion words manually with\n",
    "known orientations, and then to grow this set by searching in the WordNet dictionary for their synonyms and antonyms which we will find using NLTK library. The newly found words are added to the seed list. The next iteration starts. The iterative process stops when no more new words are\n",
    "found[12].\n",
    "\n",
    "The final result would include a sum of the negative and positive tweets and we plan to create an atlas heatmap in tableau."
